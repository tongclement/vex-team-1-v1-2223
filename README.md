Code for Team 76275A for the 2022-23 Spin Up season, using PROS and Okapilib
Uses Odometry (3x wheel encoders) and a mecannum drivetrain. Implements RTOS concepts. 

As it was our first time using PROS and Okapilib, there are a lot of improvements that need to be made so it is not recommended to use this code as any form of reference. 

We have and will continue to make improvements to our new code for the 23-24 Over Under season.
